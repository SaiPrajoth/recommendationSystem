# **User-Item Recommendation System**

This project is a **User-Item Recommendation System** that leverages a **graph-based DFS (Depth-First Search) algorithm** to provide personalized recommendations. The system dynamically loads data from an `interaction.csv` file that contains user-item interaction data. Based on the graph traversal, users can get recommendations for items (movies or any type of items they have interacted with).

---

## **Architecture**

The system uses a **graph-based approach** for recommendations:

1. **Graph Representation**:
   - **Users** and **Items** are represented as nodes.
   - An **edge** exists between a user and an item if the user has interacted with (or liked) the item.
   
2. **DFS Traversal**:
   - The recommendation system uses **DFS** to explore the graph.
   - DFS explores the connections (edges) between users and items, identifying items liked by other users who are similar or connected to the starting user.

3. **CSV-Driven Input**:
   - The interaction data is read from a CSV file, `interaction.csv`, which defines user-item interactions.

---

## **Project Files**

### **1. `main.cpp`**
- **Description**:  
  The entry point of the application that manages user input and displays the movie recommendations.

- **Key Functions**:
  - **`loadInteractions()`**: Reads user-item interaction data from `interaction.csv`.
  - **`main()`**:
    - Displays the list of usernames from the `interaction.csv` file.
    - Prompts the user to input their username.
    - Fetches and displays movie recommendations based on the DFS algorithm using the `RecommenderSystem`.

---

### **2. `RecommenderSystem.cpp`**
- **Description**:  
  Implements the recommendation logic using a **DFS-based traversal** on the user-item interaction graph.

- **Key Functions**:
  - **`addEdge()`**:
    - Adds an edge between a user and an item in the graph, establishing a connection based on interactions.
  - **`recommendItemsDFS()`**:
    - Implements the DFS algorithm to explore all connected users and gather recommendations.
  - **`getRecommendations()`**:
    - Fetches the recommendations for a given user by invoking the DFS-based recommendation algorithm.

---

### **3. `interaction.csv`**
- **Description**:  
  This file defines user-item interactions. Each line represents a user-item interaction (e.g., a user liking an item or movie).

- **Format**:
  ```csv
  user,item
  user1,item1
  user1,item2
  user2,item1
  user2,item3
  user3,item2
Columns:
user: The username of the user (e.g., user1).
item: The item (e.g., item1, item2, etc.) that the user has interacted with.
Setup Instructions
1. Prerequisites
Compiler: Ensure you have g++ installed.
CSV File: Prepare an interaction.csv file with user-item interaction data.
2. Directory Structure
Make sure the project directory structure is as follows:

css
Copy code
.
├── interaction.csv
├── main.cpp
└── RecommenderSystem.cpp
3. Compile the Code
To compile the code, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp RecommenderSystem.cpp -o movie_recommender
4. Run the Program
To run the compiled executable:

bash
Copy code
./movie_recommender
Usage Instructions
1. Start the Program
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
./movie_recommender
2. View Usernames
The system will display a list of available usernames:

sql
Copy code
Select a user from the list below:
user1
user2
user3
3. Enter Username
Enter a username (e.g., user1).

4. View Recommendations
The program will display item recommendations for the entered user:

diff
Copy code
Recommendations for user1:
- item3
- item4
How It Works
Data Loading:

The system reads data from interaction.csv and builds a graph of user-item interactions.
Graph Construction:

Users and items are represented as nodes in the graph. An edge exists between a user and an item if the user has interacted with that item.
DFS Algorithm:

The system uses DFS to traverse the graph starting from the given user.
DFS explores connected users and collects their items for recommendations.
Recommendation Filtering:

The system ensures that no duplicate items are recommended.
Commands Summary
Compilation
To compile the code, run:

bash
Copy code
g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp RecommenderSystem.cpp -o movie_recommender
Execution
Run the program:

bash
Copy code
./movie_recommender
Testing and Validation
Valid Input:

Input a username from the displayed list (e.g., user1).
Ensure recommendations are provided based on the DFS algorithm.
Invalid Input:

If an invalid username is entered, the program will output:
sql
Copy code
User not found!
Graph Traversal Test:

Verify that the DFS algorithm successfully explores all connected users and provides valid recommendations based on user-item interactions.
Future Improvements
1. Enhanced Recommendations:
Item-based or user-based collaborative filtering: By using similarity metrics such as cosine similarity or Pearson correlation, recommendations can be made based on the similarities between users or items.
2. Scaling:
For larger datasets, explore techniques to optimize graph traversal and memory usage. Implementing BFS or Random Walks can help scale the recommendation system efficiently.
3. Graph Algorithms:
Implement other graph traversal algorithms (e.g., Breadth-First Search (BFS), Dijkstra's shortest path) to compare their effectiveness for recommendations.
4. User Interface:
Create a graphical user interface (GUI) to improve user interaction with the recommendation system. A web-based interface using frameworks like React or Flask can make the system more user-friendly.
5. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) could be integrated to enhance the recommendation process by learning complex node relationships and better item recommendations.
GNNs would allow the system to better understand the underlying relationships between users and items in the graph, learning feature representations that are more effective for making recommendations.
Future Direction: Implementing GNN-based recommendations using frameworks such as PyTorch Geometric or DGL for training the model on user-item interaction data to improve accuracy and scalability.
